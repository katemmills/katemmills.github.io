        <h2>Junior in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a Junior at Bob Jones University majoring in Interdisciplinary Studies with a focus in Cinema, Business, and Theatre. I currently work as an actor and model and I also teach ballet.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy participating in choir events at my local church, Faith Baptist Church in Taylors SC. I am planning to get involved in the Sound and Video ministry there so I can use the skills I am learning in Cinema to serve God. &amp; I also love working with kids and would love to participate in the children's ministry over the summer.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also love to play softball, volleyball, soccer in my free time. Another one of my favorite things to do is go on a hike, especially if there is a beautiful sunset to watch at the end. enjoy running / hiking as well as a good book
